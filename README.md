Group project by Laurens Hamm, Jonas Hansjosten and Lennart Teuber as part of the "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" course during the Fall Semester 2019 at the University of St. Gallen.

We have developed HSG coin: a simple blockchain implementation in the form of a decentralized app (dAPP) that allows you to transfer money from a payer to a payee. In addition, we have implemented a block verification mechanism which enables you to test the validity of each block.

Our project includes a Back end which we developed using Python and a Front end based on HTML. For the main functionalities we followed a guide from Anton Tarasov (https://u.today/how-to-build-a-blockchain-application-with-python). In essence, our blockchain will be located on the hard drive where the genesis block is initialized.
