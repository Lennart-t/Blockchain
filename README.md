Group project by Laurens Hamm, Jonas Hansjosten and Lennart Teuber as part of the "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" course during the Fall Semester 2019 at the University of St. Gallen.

We have developed HSG coin: a simple blockchain implementation in the form of a decentralized app (dAPP) that allows you to transfer money from a payer to a payee. In addition, we have implemented a block verification mechanism which enables you to test the validity of each block.

Our project includes a Back End which we developed using Python and a Front End based on HTML. For the main functionalities we followed a guide from Anton Tarasov (https://u.today/how-to-build-a-blockchain-application-with-python). 

The core features of HSG Coin are:
1) Input Fields: Enter your name, the amount and the receiver and submit the information to add a block to the blockchain. The programme will not create a block if the input is invalid and display a corresponding flash message.
2) Verification: Click the button to view the validity of each block.
